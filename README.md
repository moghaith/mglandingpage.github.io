# Landing Page Project

## Instructions

As my first nanodegree project, I managed to implement the tools I learned throughout the course.
First of all, I added sections using javascript functions.

Secondly, Added active class to each section while in viewport.

Finally, I used css smooth property to add the smooth scroll property.

Hope that you provide feedback so I can enhance my project.
